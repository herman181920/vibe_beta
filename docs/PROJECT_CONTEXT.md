# Vibe Beta - Project Context Document

## Executive Summary

Vibe Beta is an AI-powered application development platform that enables users to create fully functional web applications through natural language conversations. The platform aims to democratize software development by removing technical barriers and making app creation accessible to non-programmers.

## Business Context

### Market Opportunity
- The no-code/low-code market is projected to reach $65 billion by 2027
- Growing demand for rapid application development
- Shortage of skilled developers creating opportunities for AI-assisted development
- Success of platforms like Lovable, v0, and Cursor showing market validation

### Target Audience
1. **Primary**: Entrepreneurs and small business owners without coding skills
2. **Secondary**: Developers looking to rapidly prototype
3. **Tertiary**: Educational institutions teaching app development

### Competitive Landscape
- **Lovable**: Direct competitor with similar chat-to-app functionality
- **Vercel v0**: UI component generation through chat
- **Bubble**: Visual no-code platform
- **Webflow**: Design-focused website builder

### Unique Value Proposition
- Natural language interface removing all technical complexity
- Full-stack application generation (not just UI)
- Real-time preview with hot reloading
- Export to standard code (React/Node.js) for developer handoff
- AI that learns from user preferences and improves over time

## Technical Context

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Microservices Architecture**: Scalability and independent deployment
2. **Event-Driven Design**: Real-time updates and responsive UI
3. **AI-First Approach**: Core functionality driven by LLM integration
4. **Cloud-Native**: Built for horizontal scaling from day one

### Technology Choices
- **Frontend**: React for component reusability and ecosystem
- **Backend**: Node.js for JavaScript consistency and performance
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliability and complex queries
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 for advanced code generation capabilities
- **Real-time**: WebSockets for instant preview updates

### Integration Points
- Version control systems (GitHub, GitLab)
- Cloud deployment platforms (Vercel, Netlify, AWS)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Analytics and monitoring tools
- Third-party APIs for extended functionality

## Product Strategy

### MVP Features (Phase 1)

- Plugin marketplace
- Custom AI training on user's codebase
- Enterprise security features
- White-label solutions

## Development Methodology

### Agile Practices
- 2-week sprints
- Daily standups
- Sprint reviews and retrospectives
- Continuous integration/deployment

### Quality Standards
- Test-driven development (TDD)
- Code reviews for all PRs
- Automated testing pipeline
- Performance benchmarks

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- User guides and tutorials
- Developer documentation
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
1. **AI Limitations**: Generated code quality depends on LLM capabilities
   - Mitigation: Multiple AI providers, custom fine-tuning
2. **Scalability**: Real-time preview for many users
   - Mitigation: Efficient caching, CDN usage
3. **Security**: User-generated code execution
   - Mitigation: Sandboxed environments, code scanning

### Business Risks
1. **Competition**: Large players entering the market
   - Mitigation: Focus on niche features, community building
2. **AI Costs**: High API usage costs
   - Mitigation: Efficient prompting, caching, self-hosted models
3. **User Adoption**: Learning curve for non-technical users
   - Mitigation: Extensive onboarding, video tutorials
