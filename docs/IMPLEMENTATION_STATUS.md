## Technical Debt

### High Priority
1. **AI Service Implementation**: Currently using mock responses
2. **Preview Engine**: Need actual code execution environment
3. **File Storage**: Currently storing in database, need CDN
4. **Error Handling**: Need comprehensive error boundaries

### Medium Priority
1. **State Management**: Add Zustand for complex state
2. **Testing Suite**: No tests implemented yet
3. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle size optimization needed
4. **Security Hardening**: Rate limiting, input validation

### Low Priority
1. **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support needed
2. **i18n**: Internationalization support
3. **Analytics**: Usage tracking implementation
4. **Documentation**: API documentation incomplete

## Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1 (Current)
- [x] Project setup and documentation
- [ ] AI provider integration
- [ ] Basic code generation

### Week 2
- [ ] Preview system implementation
- [ ] Monaco editor integration
- [ ] Multi-file support

### Week 3
- [ ] Project persistence
- [ ] Export functionality
- [ ] Deployment integration

### Week 4
- [ ] Testing and bug fixes
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Production deployment

## Current Blockers

1. **AI API Keys**: Need to add API keys for AI providers
2. **Preview Security**: Research sandboxing strategies
3. **File Storage**: Decide on CDN/storage solution
4. **Deployment Platform**: Choose hosting platform

## Metrics & Goals

### MVP Success Criteria
- [ ] Generate a working React app in <30 seconds
- [ ] Support 5+ project templates
- [ ] Handle 10+ files per project
- [ ] 99% uptime for preview system
- [ ] <3s page load time

### Current Performance
- Page load time: ~2s
- Build time: ~5s
- API response time: <100ms
- WebSocket latency: <50ms

## Development Guidelines

### Code Standards
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ ESLint configuration
- ✅ Prettier formatting
- ⚠️ No test coverage yet
- ⚠️ No CI/CD pipeline

### Git Workflow
- ✅ Main branch protected
- ✅ Feature branch workflow
- ✅ Commit message standards
- ⚠️ No automated testing
- ⚠️ No PR templates

## Resource Allocation

### Current Focus Areas
1. **AI Integration** (40%) - Critical path
2. **Preview System** (30%) - Core feature
3. **Editor Enhancement** (20%) - UX improvement
4. **Bug Fixes** (10%) - Maintenance

### Team Notes
- Single developer project
- ~8 hours/day development time
- External dependencies on AI APIs
- Community feedback integration planned

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
1. **AI Cost Management**: Token usage could be expensive
2. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Code execution risks
3. **Scalability**: WebSocket connection limits

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement token limits and caching
2. Use strict CSP and sandboxing
3. Add connection pooling and scaling

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. Add OpenAI API integration
2. Implement basic prompt templates
3. Test code generation flow

### This Week
1. Complete AI provider abstraction
2. Build streaming response system
3. Create preview sandbox

### This Month
1. Launch MVP beta
2. Gather user feedback
3. Iterate on UI/UX
4. Add missing features

## Notes

- Priority on core features over polish
- Focus on developer experience
- Maintain high code quality
- Document as we build
- Test with real users early
